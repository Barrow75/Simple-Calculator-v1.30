# Simple-Calculator-v1.30
The simple calculator now comes with a GUI that you can enter the numbers into. Simulates an actual calculator

IMPORTANT
-----------
If you want to do a problem such as 1-1+1 (or anything problem containing more than 2 numbers and operations) you will have to do it step by step since PEMDAS is not implemented in this program
ex: 
1-1 = 0
0+1 = 1
If you do 1-1+1 all at once you will be given the wrong number. This goes for every operation and numbers more than 2
